        <div style="display:flex;">
            <p style="padding:10px;"><b class ="bold-1">Skills:</b> I've played saxophone for 9 years, 
            and played in a wide range of styles including jazz and
            classical as well. I also have a passion for art. I also have a 
            more mathy side of my brain as well, and have always been interested 
            in learning anything I can about subjects in science.</p>
             <p style="padding:10px;"><u><b class ="bold-2">Interests:</b></u> I have many interests and hobbies. I like to spend my freetime doing fantasy concepts
            like D&D, drawing dragons or D&D characters, reading fantasy books like FableHaven, etc. I also enjoy 
            playing video games. Some of my favorites include Zelda games, as well as Super Smash Bros. 
            </p>
            <p style="padding:10px;"> <b class="bold-3">Career Goals:</b> It would be my dream to make games. I would love to be able to program and bring the game to life I always dreamed of.</li>
            However, really any type of career that balances creativety as well as a brain workout, would be a good fit for me. So it is my goal to 
            find something I can really be passionte about and contribute a lot to.
